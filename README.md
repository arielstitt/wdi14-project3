# Goal'd App

The Goal'd app's purpose is to make big goals smaller and more digestible. User's should be able to create profiles with a list of their bigs goals that they want to break down into smaller pieces.

The goals are updatable just incase the user changes his/her mind, no longer wants to complete the goal, or finishes a goal and wants to create room for new goals.

As an unorganized person with a lot of personal goals, I wanted to create something that could keep a cluttered mind on track. I also wanted to streamline the process of achievements so that accomplishing something big or small never feels stressfull or overwhelming. 

So, here you go.
