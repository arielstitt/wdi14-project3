# Goal'd App

The Goal'd app's purpose is to make big goals smaller and more digestible. User's should be able to create profiles with a list of their bigs goals that they want to break down into smaller pieces.

The goals are updatable just incase the user changes his/her mind, no longer wants to complete the goal, or finishes a goal and wants to create room for new goals.

As an unorganized person with a lot of personal goals, I wanted to create something that could keep my cluttered mind on track. I also wanted to streamline the process of achievements so that accomplishing something big or small never feels stressfull or overwhelming. 

So, here you go.

## Technologies used

* React
* Node
* JavaScript
* HTML + CSS
 *Express
* JSON
* Mongoose/ MongoDB

## Approach
I had a trello board that was pretty detailed and got me started. I tried to focus on one thing which was helpful. In the end I was only aple to accomplish the one thing, but if I focused on anything else the project would not have gotten to MVP at all.

I used the method my project was based of off to complete my task, which at the end of the day was the whole point.

## Unsolved Problems 

Heroku only shows the react splash page even though in the terminal it says that everything is up to date. 


## Notes to Future Me
The amount of frustration that when into (barely)learning this is hard to put into words. I reconsidered on several occations if I should go into this field at all,  wondered if it was too late to get my money back, and if I should go back to being happy an making candles.

For me in particular, I think this was more of a character building exersise than learning react. 
I didn't smash my computer against the wall, I didn't stop showing up to class, and I didn't call it quits and go back to making candles...mostly because I can't get my money back and at the end of the day I want to make cool stuff.

Having said all that, while doing this project I was able to pinpoint what fundamentals I don't know. Before I coudn't because I didn't know what they were. 

Hopefully through the hardship and mediocre, I am closer to becoming the developer I want to be instead of the developer I am right now.
